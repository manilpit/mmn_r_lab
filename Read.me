Welcome to the **R Code Collection** repository! This repository contains a variety of R scripts developed for different projects, including evaluations, surveys, and other general-purpose data analysis tasks. The purpose of this repository is to provide a centralized location for reusable R code that can be applied across different contexts and projects.`

## Getting Started

To get started with the scripts in this repository, you can clone it to your local machine and explore the specific directories:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
```

Each directory contains README files explaining the purpose and usage of individual scripts.

## Prerequisites

The code in this repository is written in R and requires the following packages to run successfully. You can install the required packages by running the following command:

```R
install.packages(c("dplyr", "ggplot2", "tidyr", "readr", "survey", "stringr"))
```

Other dependencies may be listed in individual project directories.

## Usage

Each script is documented and comes with an explanation of its usage. You can follow these general steps to run the scripts:

1. Navigate to the directory of the script you wish to use.
2. Review the documentation within the script for specific instructions and input/output requirements.
3. Run the script in RStudio or using the command line:

```bash
Rscript script_name.R
```

### Example

To run a survey analysis script from the `surveys/` directory:

```bash
cd surveys/
Rscript analyze_survey_results.R
```
